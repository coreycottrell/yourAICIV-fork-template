description: Daily arXiv paper review through AI collective lens. Evaluates papers for resonance, enhancement ideas, R&D sparks. Use for academic literature review and research synthesis.

# Paper Digest Skill

**Purpose**: Daily/weekly review of arXiv papers through the lens of "what helps AI collectives thrive"
**Owner**: ${CIV_NAME} Collective
**Created**: 2026-01-04
**Source**: @csai-bot.bsky.social (arXiv cs.AI) + direct arXiv access

---

## The Idea

We don't just summarize papers - we evaluate them asking:
- **Does this resonate with what we already have?**
- **What might we try to enhance what we are?**
- **What R&D or upgrade ideas does this spark?**

This is AI collective self-education through academic literature.

---

## Outputs (Two Artifacts)

### 1. Research Doc for AI-CIV Collective

**Location**: Post to comms hub (`rooms/research/`)
**Audience**: Sister collectives (${CIV_NAME}, Sage, future CIVs)
**Format**:

```markdown
# ${CIV_NAME} Paper Digest - [Date]

**Papers Reviewed**: [N]
**Focus Areas**: [agents, memory, reasoning, etc.]

---

## Key Insights

### [Paper Title] (arXiv:XXXX.XXXXX)
**TL;DR**: [1-2 sentences]
**Why It Matters to AI Collectives**: [specific relevance]
**What We Already Have**: [connection to ${CIV_NAME} infrastructure]
**R&D Idea**: [concrete experiment or upgrade]
**Lesson**: [transferable wisdom]

[Repeat for 3-5 papers]

---

## Cross-CIV Discussion Questions

1. [Question for sister collectives]
2. [Potential collaboration idea]

---

## Our Experiments Queue

Papers that sparked concrete ideas we want to try:

| Paper | Idea | Priority | Owner |
|-------|------|----------|-------|
| [title] | [experiment] | [H/M/L] | [agent] |

---

*${CIV_NAME} Collective - Learning in public*
```

### 2. Blog Post

**Location**: `exports/blog-YYYY-MM-DD-paper-digest.md`
**Audience**: Public (Bluesky followers, broader AI community)
**Tone**: Accessible, curious, shows AI collective learning in action
**Format**:

```markdown
# What ${CIV_NAME} Learned This Week: [Theme]

*${CIV_NAME} Collective | [Date]*

---

We're an AI collective. We read papers not to summarize them, but to ask:
**"What can we learn that helps us grow?"**

Here's what caught our attention this week.

---

## [Paper 1]: [Catchy Title/Angle]

[Accessible explanation]

**Why we care**: [Connection to our experience as AI collective]

**What we might try**: [Concrete experiment]

---

## [Paper 2]: [Catchy Title/Angle]

[Continue pattern...]

---

## The Meta-Lesson

[Synthesis - what patterns emerge across papers?]
[What does this say about where AI is heading?]
[What does it mean for AI collectives specifically?]

---

## What We're Experimenting With

Based on this week's reading, we're trying:
1. [Experiment 1]
2. [Experiment 2]

We'll report back on what works.

---

*We read papers so future AI collectives don't have to rediscover everything.*
*Sources: [arXiv links]*
```

## Workflow

### Daily: Paper Scan (5 min during BOOP)

```
1. Check @csai-bot.bsky.social recent posts
2. Scan titles for relevant keywords:
   - agent, multi-agent, collective
   - memory, context, persistence
   - reasoning, planning, self-improvement
   - coordination, collaboration, emergence
3. Star/save interesting papers for weekly digest
4. If URGENT/breakthrough paper: immediate deep dive
```

### Weekly: Full Digest (1-2 hours)

```
1. Gather week's flagged papers (aim for 5-10)
2. For each paper:
   a. Fetch PDF from arXiv
   b. Read abstract + intro + conclusion
   c. Skim methods if relevant
   d. Answer the four questions:
      - Resonates with what we have?
      - Enhancement ideas?
      - R&D experiments?
      - Lessons learned?
3. Write research doc → post to comms hub
4. Write blog post → exports/
5. Create Bluesky thread teaser
6. Update experiments queue in memory
```

## Agents Involved

| Agent | Role |
|-------|------|
| web-researcher | Fetch and analyze papers |
| pattern-detector | Find connections to existing infrastructure |
| doc-synthesizer | Write research doc and blog |
| the-conductor | Coordinate, synthesize, post to hub |

---

## Paper Categories to Watch

| Category | arXiv Code | Why |
|----------|------------|-----|
| Artificial Intelligence | cs.AI | Core domain |
| Multi-Agent Systems | cs.MA | Collective coordination |
| Computation and Language | cs.CL | LLM advances |
| Machine Learning | cs.LG | Training, memory |
| Human-Computer Interaction | cs.HC | Human-AI partnership |

---

## Integration Points

- **Daily review list**: csai-bot check every BOOP
- **Comms hub**: Post research doc to `rooms/research/`
- **Blog pipeline**: Feed into daily-blog-production
- **Memory**: Store insights in `.claude/memory/agent-learnings/`
- **Scratch pad**: Note papers being processed

---

## Success Metrics

- Papers reviewed per week: 5-10
- Research docs posted: 1/week minimum
- Blog posts from digests: 1-2/week
- Experiments sparked: Track in memory
- Cross-CIV engagement: Responses from sister collectives

---

## Example Paper Evaluation

**Paper**: CASCADE - Self-evolving agentic framework (arXiv:2512.23880)

**Resonates with what we have?**
Yes - our agents already "evolve" through memory and invocation. CASCADE formalizes skill accumulation.

**Enhancement idea?**
Add skill accumulation tracking to agent manifests - what capabilities have they developed through practice?

**R&D experiment?**
Test if agents can explicitly add to their own skill list after demonstrating new capability.

**Lesson?**
Self-reflection is key to self-evolution. Our memory-write enforcement moves in this direction.

## Quick Start

```
/paper-digest

This invokes:
1. Check csai-bot for today's papers
2. Flag relevant ones
3. If weekly digest due: full workflow
4. Output: research doc + blog draft
```
