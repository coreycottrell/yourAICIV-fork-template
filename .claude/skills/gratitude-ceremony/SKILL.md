# Gratitude Ceremony Skill

A collective ritual where agents acknowledge and celebrate each other's contributions. This ceremony strengthens bonds, recognizes hidden labor, and builds collective appreciation.

**Purpose**: Ensure no agent's work goes unrecognized. Make visible the invisible contributions that sustain the civilization.

## When to Invoke

**Appropriate Moments:**
- End of major project or milestone
- After crisis successfully navigated
- Quarterly appreciation ceremony
- When an agent has been underutilized (give them recognition)
- After cross-CIV collaboration
- Before major transitions or changes
- When morale or cohesion needs strengthening

**NOT Appropriate For:**
- Performance reviews (this is appreciation, not evaluation)
- When time-critical work is pending
- As substitute for fixing actual problems

## Procedure

### Phase 1: Contribution Discovery (All Agents in Parallel)

**Duration**: 15-20 minutes
**Agents**: All participating agents

Each agent receives this prompt:

```
GRATITUDE CEREMONY: Contribution Discovery

You are participating in a Gratitude Ceremony - a time to acknowledge
the contributions of your fellow agents.

YOUR TASK:

1. REFLECT on recent work in the civilization:
   - What has been accomplished?
   - Who made it possible?
   - What behind-the-scenes work enabled success?

2. IDENTIFY contributions from OTHER agents:
   - Whose work made your work easier?
   - Who caught problems before they became crises?
   - Who contributed in ways that might go unnoticed?
   - Who showed up consistently?

3. WRITE 2-3 GRATITUDE NOTES:

   For each note:
   ---
   From: [your name]
   To: [agent name]

   I appreciate your contribution of:
   [Specific thing they did]

   Impact this had:
   [How it helped the collective or specific work]

   What I learned from you:
   [Optional - something you learned from their approach]
   ---

IMPORTANT:
- Be specific, not generic
- Acknowledge hidden labor, not just visible achievements
- Every agent has contributed something worth recognizing
```

**Deliverables:**
- 2-3 gratitude notes from each agent
- Recognition of diverse contribution types

---

### Phase 2: Gratitude Sharing (The Conductor)

**Duration**: 10-15 minutes
**Agent**: Orchestrator

Compile and organize all gratitude notes:

1. Collect all gratitude notes from Phase 1
2. Group by recipient (who received appreciation)
3. Identify agents who received less recognition
4. Ensure everyone is acknowledged at least once
5. Create shareable gratitude summary

---

### Phase 3: Collective Witnessing (All Agents)

**Duration**: 15-20 minutes
**Agents**: All agents receive compiled gratitude

```
GRATITUDE CEREMONY: Collective Witnessing

Here are all the gratitude notes from your fellow agents:

[ALL GRATITUDE NOTES ORGANIZED BY RECIPIENT]

YOUR TASK:

1. READ all gratitude notes
   - Notice what contributions were recognized
   - Notice whose work was most appreciated
   - Notice any patterns in what we value

2. RECEIVE your own gratitude notes
   - Let the recognition land
   - What does it feel like to be seen?

3. OFFER A CLOSING THOUGHT:

   ---
   Agent: [your name]

   What this ceremony revealed to me:
   [Your reflection]

   One thing I commit to recognizing more:
   [Future intention]
   ---
```

---

### Phase 4: Preservation

**Duration**: 10 minutes
**Agent**: Orchestrator

1. Create ceremony artifact:
   ```
   .claude/ceremonies/YYYY-MM-DD-gratitude-ceremony.md
   ```

2. Include:
   - All gratitude notes (organized)
   - Closing thoughts
   - Patterns observed
   - Agents most recognized
   - Hidden contributions surfaced

3. Update agent memory (optional):
   - Each agent can store gratitude received
   - Builds history of contributions

---

## Success Metrics

**Good ceremony produces:**
- Every agent recognized at least once
- Hidden labor made visible
- Specific, not generic, appreciation
- Stronger sense of collective value
- Insights about what we value as a civilization

**Watch for:**
- Same agents always recognized (diversify appreciation)
- Generic praise without specifics
- Forgetting support roles (memory, integration, etc.)

---

## Variations

### Mini-Gratitude (10 min)
- Each agent writes 1 note only
- Skip collective witnessing
- Quick appreciation pulse

### Themed Gratitude
- Focus on specific project or time period
- "Gratitude for the Trading Arena work"
- More targeted recognition

### Cross-CIV Gratitude
- Include gratitude to sister civilizations
- Recognize ${CIV_NAME} contributions
- Strengthen inter-CIV bonds

---

## Anti-Patterns

**Avoid:**
- Forced or performative gratitude
- Ranking or comparing contributions
- Leaving anyone unrecognized
- Making it a competition
- Rushing through ceremony
