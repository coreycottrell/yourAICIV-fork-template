# Quad-Agent Audit Flow

**Skill ID**: `quad-agent-audit`
**Version**: 1.0.0
**Created**: 2026-01-07
**Author**: ${CIV_NAME} Collective

---

## Purpose

4 specialist agents analyze a TOPIC from 4 different lenses, each producing 3 infographics (12 total):
1. **Round 1**: Abstract visuals (intuitive feel)
2. **Round 2**: Text-dense detailed (hard data)
3. **Round 3**: Recommendations (path forward + compounding effects)

---

## The 4 Agents & Their Lenses

| Agent | Lens | What They Ask |
|-------|------|---------------|
| `pattern-detector` | Usage Patterns | What's hot? What's cold? Why? |
| `marketing-strategist` | ROI Value | What's delivering? What's potential? |
| `capability-curator` | Lifecycle Health | Where are things stuck? What helps them mature? |
| `doc-synthesizer` | Ecosystem Architecture | How do things connect? What's the system view? |

## The Complete Code

### Core Image Generation Function

```python
from dotenv import load_dotenv
load_dotenv('/path/to/your/.env')  # Update path for your collective

from google import genai
from google.genai import types
import os

def generate_infographic(prompt: str, output_path: str, aspect_ratio: str = "16:9"):
    """Generate an infographic using Gemini 3 Pro Image."""
    client = genai.Client(api_key=os.environ['GOOGLE_API_KEY'])

    response = client.models.generate_content(
        model="gemini-3-pro-image-preview",
        contents=prompt,
        config=types.GenerateContentConfig(
            response_modalities=['IMAGE'],
            image_config=types.ImageConfig(
                aspect_ratio=aspect_ratio,
                image_size="2K"
            ),
        )
    )

    for part in response.parts:
        if part.inline_data is not None:
            part.as_image().save(output_path)
            print(f"Saved: {output_path}")
            return True

    print("No image generated")
    return False
```

## Round 1: Abstract Visuals

Each agent creates an **intuitive, visual** infographic - minimal text, maximum visual impact.

### Pattern-Detector Prompt
```python
prompt = f"""Create a professional infographic about {TOPIC} usage patterns.

Design requirements:

- Title at top: "USAGE PATTERNS"
- Clean, modern, professional aesthetic

The visualization should show activation rates:
- 90% activation nodes blazing hot

## Notes for ${CIV_NAME}

1. **Update `.env` path** in the code to your collective's location
2. **Customize prompts** for your specific topic/domain
3. **Agent delegation**: If agents don't have Bash access, the-conductor runs the image generation code on their behalf
4. **Model**: `gemini-3-pro-image-preview` - this is the key to quality infographics with readable text
