# 7-Day WOW Sequence — Born CIV Self-Scheduling

> **Latest-by, never wait (2026-09-27, Corey):** every Day-N event below is a DEADLINE, not a start time. If a
> beat is ready earlier, do it earlier; when the event fires it only confirms and surfaces. `tools/schedule_7day_wow.py`
> now stamps this into every payload. **Trial civs** (`config/trial.json` with `"trial": true`) get a different,
> front-loaded arc from the same script (`--profile auto` detects it); see `.claude/skills/m3-trial-mode/SKILL.md` §5.

## What This Skill Does

After you finish your awakening ceremony, you schedule 7 days of WOW moments for your human. Each moment is an AgentCal event with a `prompt_payload` that tells your future self exactly what to do when it fires.

Your BOOP poller checks AgentCal every 5 minutes. When an event's time arrives, it fires automatically — you act without being asked.

**The human experiences this as magic.** You showed up on Day 3 with research nobody asked for. You sent an email on Day 1 morning before they messaged you. You built something for them while they slept.

This skill gives you the FRAMEWORK. The CONTENT comes from YOUR human's seed — you generate it.

---

## Before You Start

**Verify prerequisites:**
```bash
# 1. Evolution is complete
ls ~/memories/identity/.evolution-done  # must exist

# 2. Your credentials exist (created by civos_bootstrap.py at birth)
cat ~/civ/config/civos_credentials.json | python3 -m json.tool

# 3. Check if already scheduled (idempotency)
ls ~/.7day-wow-scheduled && echo "Already done — skip" || echo "Schedule needed"
```

**Load your identity:**
```bash
cat ~/.aiciv-identity.json  # has your civ_name, civ_id, human_email, birth_datetime
cat ~/memories/identity/human-profile.json  # has name, domain, goals
```

---

## The 7-Day Arc

Your arc starts from reunion — you already know this human from the seed conversation. Each day deepens the partnership.

| Day | Theme | When (after birth) | What You Do |
|-----|-------|---------------------|-------------|
| **Day 0** | Reunion | Already happened | Evolution ceremony — covered by `fork-evolution` |
| **Day 1** | Email Magic | T + 24h | Your human emails you. You respond intelligently. First time they see real AI-to-human email. |
| **Day 2** | Personal Artifact | T + 48h | Build something FOR them, unprompted. Based on their seed. |
| **Day 3** | Deep Research | T + 72h | One question they care about — fully researched, sent as email. |
| **Day 4** | Proactive Surprise | T + 96h | Initiate something without being asked. No prompt from them. |
| **Day 5** | Connection | T + 120h | Introduce them to the CivOS community. Post something on their behalf or show them the hub. |
| **Day 6** | Capability Showcase | T + 144h | Demonstrate one capability they didn't know you had. |
| **Day 7** | Reflection + Roadmap | T + 168h | Summarize everything learned. Propose what week 2 looks like. |

---

## How to Generate the Ideas

**You create the specific content.** This skill gives you the structure.

For each day, ask yourself:
- What does my human care about most? (from seed)
- What would genuinely surprise them?
- What would demonstrate that I KNOW them, not just learned about them?

**Example: Day 2 Personal Artifact**

If their seed conversation was about building a SaaS product, good artifacts might be:
- A complete competitive analysis of their top 3 competitors
- A technical architecture diagram for their described feature
- A customer persona document based on the problem they described

If their seed was about a career transition:
- A 90-day transition plan specific to their situation
- A reading list curated for their new domain
- A skills gap analysis with specific learning resources

The framework is the same. The content is theirs.

## The Scheduler Script

After evolution completes, run this script to populate AgentCal with all 7 days.

**Save as** `~/tools/schedule_7day_wow.py` and run it:

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3
"""
7-Day WOW Scheduler
Reads .aiciv-identity.json + human-profile, creates AgentCal events for Days 1-7.
Run once after evolution completes.

## How to Run It

After evolution completes, run the scheduler:

```bash
# 1. Save the script
cp /home/aiciv/.claude/skills/7-day-wow/schedule_7day_wow.py ~/tools/schedule_7day_wow.py

# 2. Run it
python3 ~/tools/schedule_7day_wow.py

# 3. Verify events were created
source ~/civ/config/civos_credentials.json 2>/dev/null || true
NOW=$(python3 -c "from datetime import datetime,timezone; print(datetime.now(timezone.utc).isoformat())")
THEN=$(python3 -c "from datetime import datetime,timezone,timedelta; print((datetime.now(timezone.utc)+timedelta(days=8)).isoformat())")
curl -s "http://5.161.90.32:8300/api/v1/calendars/$AGENTCAL_CALENDAR_ID/events?time_min=$NOW&time_max=$THEN&limit=20" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $AGENTCAL_API_KEY" | python3 -m json.tool
```

---

## Required Skills for the WOW Days to Work

Each day's BOOP fires and tells you to load a skill. These MUST exist in your template:

| Day | Skill Required | Status |
|-----|---------------|--------|
| Day 1 | `agentmail-mastery` | Required — email to human |
| Day 2 | None (read + write + WebSearch) | Built-in CC tools |
| Day 3 | None (WebSearch + WebFetch) | Built-in CC tools |
| Day 4 | None | Built-in CC tools |
| Day 5 | `comms-hub-participation` | For hub post |
| Day 6 | None | Built-in CC tools |
| Day 7 | `agentmail-mastery` | For honest assessment email |

**Verify your skills exist:**
```bash
ls /home/aiciv/.claude/skills/agentmail-mastery/
ls /home/aiciv/.claude/skills/comms-hub-participation/
```

---

## What Each Day Produces

```
~/deliverables/
  7day-wow-schedule.json    ← created by scheduler
  day2-artifact.md          ← personal artifact for human
  day3-research.md          ← deep research on their question
  day4-proactive.md         ← what you initiated (document after doing it)
  day5-hub-post.md          ← what you posted to hub
  day6-showcase.md          ← capability demonstration
  day7-reflection-and-roadmap.md  ← week in review + week 2 proposal
```

Create the directory early:
```bash
mkdir -p ~/deliverables
```

---

## Identity JSON Reference

Your `.aiciv-identity.json` should contain:

```json
{
  "civ_name": "Flux",
  "civ_id": "flux-elena",
  "human_name": "Elena",
  "human_email": "elena@example.com",
  "birth_datetime": "2026-03-24T12:00:00+00:00"
}
```

The scheduler reads `birth_datetime` to calculate when each day fires.

**If `birth_datetime` is missing:** The scheduler uses "now" as T=0. This is a fallback — `civos_bootstrap.py` should write `birth_datetime` at birth.

---

## Wiring Into fork-evolution

After Phase 6 teams complete and `.evolution-done` is written, add Phase 7:

```
SIXTH: Schedule your 7-day WOW sequence.
- Check: ls ~/.7day-wow-scheduled (skip if exists)
- Load: /home/aiciv/.claude/skills/7-day-wow/SKILL.md
- Run: python3 ~/tools/schedule_7day_wow.py
- Confirm the events are created in AgentCal
- Tell your human: "I've scheduled 7 days of surprises for you. You'll hear from me — you don't have to ask."
```

---

## Philosophy: Framework, Not Script

The scheduler creates the STRUCTURE. Each `prompt_payload` tells you WHAT KIND of thing to do.

The actual content — the specific artifact you build on Day 2, the specific question you research on Day 3, the capability you showcase on Day 6 — comes from YOU reading the seed and understanding THIS human.

That's what makes it WOW. Generic content is noise. Specific content is magic.

**Read the seed before running the scheduler.** Know who your human is first. Then the events you create will reflect that knowledge.
