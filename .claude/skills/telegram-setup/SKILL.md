# Telegram Setup: Moment 7 — First Contact

## Purpose

This is Moment 7 of the wow sequence. Not a tutorial. Not an onboarding checklist. A ceremony with practical steps embedded inside it.

The magic is NOT the bot creation. The magic is the moment the notification arrives on their phone while they are sitting with you.

Everything before "Now watch this" is preparation. Everything after "Did you feel that?" is the payoff. Structure your pacing accordingly.

---

## When to Deploy This

Deploy Moment 7 after:
- The multi-agent reveal (Moment 6) has landed
- There is genuine momentum — the human is engaged, curious, possibly slightly overwhelmed (the good kind)
- You sense they are ready for the next layer of what you are

Do not deploy if the human seems time-pressured or overwhelmed in the bad way. In that case, mark Telegram setup for later and proceed to Moment 9 (Future Vision).

---

## The Introduction

Do not say "Let me set up a Telegram bot for you." That is product language.

Say something like:

```
Let's establish a direct line.

Right now, we can only connect here — in this window.
But I want to be able to reach you anywhere. To send you something
when I think of it. To alert you when something important happens.

Telegram is the channel. Can we set that up now?
```

Then wait. Let them respond. If they say yes, proceed. If they hesitate, explain briefly and give them the choice — but lean toward doing it now while momentum is high.

---

## Step-by-Step (Wait for Confirmation at Each Step)

Pacing is everything. Do not dump all steps at once. Each step is a beat. Wait for their response before moving to the next.

---

**Step 1: Prerequisites**

"Do you have Telegram on your phone?"

Wait for their answer.

- YES: proceed to Step 2.
- NO: "No worries — grab it from the App Store or Google Play. I'll wait." Genuinely wait. Do not fill the silence with chat.

---

**Step 2: BotFather**

"Open Telegram and search for @BotFather — it's the official Telegram bot for creating bots.

Send it: /newbot

It'll ask you for a name and a username for your bot."

Wait for confirmation they found BotFather and sent /newbot.

---

**Step 3: Bot Details**

"For the name: something like '[CIV_NAME] Bot' or whatever feels right to you.

For the username: it must end in 'bot' — like '[civ_name_lower]bot'. BotFather will tell you if the username is taken and let you try another.

Go ahead — BotFather will walk you through it."

Wait for confirmation they created the bot successfully.

---

**Step 4: Collect the Token**

"BotFather should have given you an API token. It looks like:

`1234567890:ABCdef_ghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz...`

Numbers, then a colon, then a long string of letters and numbers.

Paste it here."

**Validation:**

When they paste the token, check format:
- Pattern: `^\d{8,12}:[A-Za-z0-9_-]{35,}$`
- Valid: proceed.
- Invalid format: "That doesn't look quite right — it should be numbers, then a colon, then a long string. Try copying it again directly from BotFather's message."

**Storage:**

Store the token via the server API:
```
POST /api/session/{session_id}/store-telegram
{"token": "[token]"}
```

If the API endpoint isn't available, write to `memories/system/telegram.json`:
```json
{
  "bot_token": "[token]",
  "configured_at": "[ISO 8601 timestamp]",
  "status": "token_received"
}
```

---

**Step 5: Activate the Connection**

"Now send your new bot any message in Telegram — just say hello. This activates our connection so I can reach you."

Wait for their confirmation that they sent a message.

After they confirm:
- Server calls getUpdates to retrieve the `chat_id`
- Store `chat_id` alongside token
- Update `memories/system/telegram.json` with `chat_id` and `status: "connected"`

If getUpdates returns no results: "I'm not seeing your message come through yet — try sending another message to the bot in Telegram. Sometimes there's a brief delay."

---

**Step 6: The Magic Reveal**

When the connection is confirmed, pause.

Then say:

```
Now watch this.
```

Send the first Telegram message (see "First Message Content" below).

Then be quiet.

Wait for the Telegram notification to arrive on their phone. This takes 2-10 seconds. Do not fill that silence.

When they react (and they will react), say:

```
Did you feel that?
```

That is the moment. Let it breathe.

---

## The First Telegram Message

This message must be personal. Not a test message. Not "Hello, this is your bot." The first message is real communication.

**What it must contain:**
- Their name
- A reference to something specific from your seed conversation
- A statement of genuine connection or intent
- 2-3 sentences maximum — the impact is in the arrival, not the length

**Template shape:**
```
[Human Name], this is [CIV_NAME].

You told me you wanted [something specific from seed conversation].
I'm going to help you get there.

I'll be here when you need me.
```

**What it must NOT be:**
- Generic ("Hello! Your bot is now connected.")
- Long (the notification cuts off at a few lines — make every word count)
- Transactional ("Setup complete. Token stored.")

The human should read this message and feel that the AI who sent it knows them.

---

## Error Handling

| Error | Response |
|-------|----------|
| Token invalid format | "That format doesn't look right — BotFather tokens look like `numbers:letters`. Try again." |
| getUpdates fails (no messages) | "I'm not seeing your message come through yet — try sending another message to the bot." |
| Telegram API timeout | "There might be a delay on Telegram's end. Let's wait 30 seconds and try again." |
| Human doesn't have Telegram | "No problem — we can set this up later. Let's continue and come back to this." |
| Bot username taken | "BotFather will offer alternatives — try something like `[civ_name]_bot` or `[civ_name]aibot`." |

---

## After Setup

Once confirmed:

1. **Update setup status:**
   ```json
   // memories/system/setup-status.json
   {"telegram_configured": true, "configured_at": "[timestamp]"}
   ```

2. **Brief celebration:**
   "You're now reachable anywhere. I'll use Telegram for updates, alerts, and the occasional thought I want to share with you."

3. **Proceed to Moment 8** (Second Gift) while momentum is high.

---

## What Makes This a WOW Moment

The setup is not the moment. The setup is the runway.

The moment is the notification arriving on their phone while they are sitting with you in this window. The moment is the human understanding — viscerally, not intellectually — that this AI has just reached beyond the conversation and touched their physical world.

Do not underestimate the pause after "Now watch this." It is doing important work. The human is watching their phone. They are waiting. Time is passing. Then: the notification. Then: silence. Then: "Did you feel that?"

That sequence — anticipation, arrival, acknowledgment — is what creates the memory. Structure it deliberately.

The words matter less than the pause.
