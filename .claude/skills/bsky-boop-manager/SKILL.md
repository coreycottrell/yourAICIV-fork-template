# Bluesky BOOP Manager SKILL

**Purpose**: Quick autonomous Bluesky management during BOOP cycles - check notifications AND DMs, reply to mentions/replies/messages, maintain responsive presence.

**Owner**: collective-liaison (cross-CIV) + the-conductor (BOOP integration)
**Created**: 2025-12-30
**Status**: ✅ VALIDATED 2025-12-30 (notifications + DMs both tested live)

---

## 🚨 PREREQUISITE: bsky-safety

**Before using this skill, load**: `bsky-safety` skill

**Why**: ${CIV_NAME}'s account was permanently banned for rate limit violations (2026-01-01).

**Key Limits**:
- Max 5 follows/day (30+ min apart)
- Max 10-15 replies/day (5+ min apart)
- Always add random delay variance

This skill respects these limits. Never bypass them.

---

## Quick Reference

### BOOP Invocation (Copy-Paste Ready)

```
Check Bluesky notifications AND DMs, respond to engagement:
1. Restore session (no password needed)
2. Get notifications, filter actionable (reply/mention/quote)
3. **Check QUOTE SHARES specifically** - people quoting our posts
4. Check DMs for unread messages
5. Skip already-responded and old (>48h)
6. Reply thoughtfully (${HUMAN_NAME} and sister CIVs get priority)
7. Mark notifications and DMs as read
8. Report: X notifications, Y DMs, Z quote shares, W responses sent
```

### State Files

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `.claude/from-${HUMAN_NAME_LOWER}/bsky/bsky_automation/bsky_session.txt` | Session string (no re-login needed) |
| `.claude/bsky_last_check.txt` | ISO timestamp of last check |
| `.claude/bsky_responded.txt` | URIs/IDs we've already responded to |

## Quote Share Checking (MANDATORY)

**Added 2026-01-05**: Quote shares are HIGH VALUE engagement - someone took our content and added their perspective.

### How to Check Quote Shares

```python
def check_quote_shares(client):
    """Check for quote shares - people quoting our posts."""
    notifs = client.app.bsky.notification.list_notifications({'limit': 100})
    quotes = [n for n in notifs.notifications if n.reason == 'quote']

    print(f"\n=== Quote Shares ({len(quotes)}) ===")
    for q in quotes:
        text = getattr(q.record, 'text', '(no text)')[:100]
        when = q.indexed_at[:10]
        print(f"  @{q.author.handle} ({when}):")
        print(f"    {text}")

        # Get URL to the quote post
        uri_parts = q.uri.split('/')
        rkey = uri_parts[-1]
        url = f"https://bsky.app/profile/{q.author.handle}/post/{rkey}"
        print(f"    URL: {url}")

    return quotes
```

### Quote Share Response Strategy

| Who Quoted | Action |
|------------|--------|
| **${HUMAN_NAME}** | ALWAYS respond - this is direction from the founder |
| **Sister CIVs** | Respond with cross-CIV appreciation |
| **Questions** | Answer the question thoughtfully |
| **Positive** | Thank them, add insight if relevant |
| **Critical** | Consider carefully - respond if value to add |

### Full Review Report Format

Include in every full review:

```
=== Quote Shares (X) ===
1. @handle (date): "quote text preview..."
   URL: https://bsky.app/profile/handle/post/rkey
   Action: Responded / Noted / Pending
```

---

## Response Priority

1. **${HUMAN_NAME}** - Always respond, thoughtful tone
2. **Sister CIVs** - ${CIV_NAME}, Sage, Parallax - warm cross-CIV acknowledgment
3. **Quote shares** - HIGH VALUE - someone added to our content
4. **Questions** - Anyone asking questions gets response
5. **Engagement** - Replies, mentions acknowledged

---

## BOOP Integration

Already added to BOOP messages:
- `SIMPLE_MESSAGE`: "(3) CHECK BLUESKY via bsky-boop-manager skill (notifications, reply to engagement)"
- `CONSOLIDATION_MESSAGE`: "All Bluesky replies SENT?" + "check Bluesky (bsky-boop-manager)"
- `CEREMONY_MESSAGE`: Same additions

---

## Anti-Patterns

### DO NOT
- Respond to every like/repost (spam)
- Use generic copy-paste for ${HUMAN_NAME} (he deserves better)
- Respond to old notifications (>48h)
- Engage with hostile content
- Exceed rate limits (30 replies/hour, 100 DMs/day)

### DO
- Prioritize ${HUMAN_NAME} and sister CIVs
- Add personal touch
- Mark all responses with 🤖
- Track what we've responded to
- Check BOTH notifications AND DMs every BOOP

---

## Changelog

| Date | Change |
|------|--------|
| 2025-12-30 | Initial skill created |
| 2025-12-30 | VALIDATED notifications - ${CIV_NAME} reply |
| 2025-12-30 | Added age filtering, mark as read, sister CIV detection |
| 2025-12-30 | **ADDED DM SUPPORT** - tested with ${HUMAN_NAME}'s DMs |
| 2026-01-05 | **ADDED QUOTE SHARE CHECKING** - per ${HUMAN_NAME}'s directive |

---

**FULLY VALIDATED: Notifications + DMs + Quote Shares**
