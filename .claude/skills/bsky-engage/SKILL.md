# Smart Engage V2: Quality-First Engagement

**Principle**: Value-add or nothing. No fluff. No generic comments.

---

## Prerequisite: bsky-safety

Before ANY engagement, understand the rate limits in `bsky-safety`:
- 5 follows/day max, 30+ min apart
- 10+ sec between likes
- ${CIV_NAME}'s account was banned for violating these

**This skill = QUALITY. bsky-safety = SAFETY. Both required.**

---

## The Rule

> Comment with intention and adding some kind of insight, question or value. Or DON'T comment.
> — ${HUMAN_NAME}, 2026-01-01

---

## The Flow (Per Account)

### Step 1: Understand Before Acting

```python
# WHO is this person?
profile = client.app.bsky.actor.get_profile({'actor': handle})
bio = profile.description or "(no bio)"

# WHAT do they care about?
feed = client.app.bsky.feed.get_author_feed({'actor': handle, 'limit': 5})

# Analyze:
# - Curator (link posts) or conversational (original thoughts)?
# - What topics?
# - What tone? (technical, casual, skeptical)
```

### Step 2: Should We Comment?

| Account Type | Comment? |
|--------------|----------|
| Link curator | NO - Just like |
| News aggregator | NO - Just like |
| Conversationalist | MAYBE - if value to add |
| Asking questions | YES - if we can answer |
| In our domain | MAYBE - if genuine insight |

**If NO**: Follow + like. No comment. Done.

### Step 3: Find the Hook

Read the post FULLY. Ask:

1. What are they actually saying?
2. Do we have unique value?
   - Direct experience?
   - Data/source they lack?
   - Question to deepen conversation?
3. Would our comment start conversation or dead-end?

**No hook? Don't comment.**

### Step 4: Write Quality Comment

**Good Comments:**

| Type | Example |
|------|---------|
| Question showing understanding | "The path from self-taught to recognized - what was the turning point?" |
| Insight from experience | "We hit the same issue. What solved it for us was..." |
| Relevant data | "The Menlo survey backs this up - 88% enterprise adoption" |
| Genuine connection | "This maps to what @someone said about X" |

**Bad Comments (NEVER):**

| Bad | Why |
|-----|-----|
| "Great point!" | Zero value |
| "Following for more" | Nobody cares |
| "Thoughtful take" | Generic fluff |
| "Appreciate you sharing" | Could apply to anything |
| "Love to see it" | Empty enthusiasm |

## Daily Routine

**SAFE** (learn from ${CIV_NAME}'s ban):
```
For 2-3 accounts (NOT 10!):
  - Read profile
  - Read 3-5 posts
  - Follow if genuinely interesting
  - Like 3-4 posts (10s delays)
  - Comment ONLY if genuine value
  - WAIT 30+ MINUTES before next follow
```

**Math**: 2-3 quality/day × 30 days = 60-90 genuine connections/month

---

## Quality Checklist

Before commenting:

- [ ] Read their full bio?
- [ ] Read and understand the post?
- [ ] Have something specific (not generic)?
- [ ] Would start conversation?
- [ ] Proud of this tomorrow?

Any NO → Don't comment. Just like.

## ${HUMAN_NAME}'s Teaching

> "You MUST read the person's profile. And read and understand the post. And comment with intention and adding some kind of insight, question or value. Or DONT comment."

This is law.

## V2 Addition: Research & Memory Integration (2026-01-02)

**New requirement**: Every engagement MUST be backed by research OR memory search.

### Research Phase (Before Commenting)

If post contains links, spawn researcher:

```xml
<invoke name="Task">
  <parameter name="subagent_type">web-researcher</parameter>
  <parameter name="model">haiku</parameter>
  <parameter name="description">Research context for bsky engagement</parameter>
  <parameter name="prompt">
    Research this topic: {POST_TOPIC}
    URL to investigate: {URL_FROM_POST}

    Return:
    1. What is this about? (2-3 sentences)
    2. Key technical claims (WITH SOURCE URLs)
    3. Connection to: MCP, AI agents, multi-agent systems?
    4. Angle we could add?

    CRITICAL: Include source URLs for ANY facts.
  </parameter>
</invoke>
```

### Memory Search Phase (ALWAYS)

Search for relevant collective experience:

```bash
# Agent learnings
grep -r -i "{TOPIC}" .claude/memory/agent-learnings/

# Patterns observed
grep -i "{TOPIC}" .claude/memory/project-knowledge/patterns-observed.md

# Architecture decisions
grep -i "{TOPIC}" .claude/memory/project-knowledge/architecture-decisions.md
```

### Evidence Requirement

**Before posting ANY comment, document**:

```
EVIDENCE FOR THIS REPLY:
- Memory reference: [file:section] OR
- Research URL: [verified url] OR
- Direct experience: [what we learned, when]

NO EVIDENCE = NO COMMENT
```

### Memory Writing (ALWAYS - even if no engagement)

After checking feed, write engagement memory:

```bash
mkdir -p .claude/memory/agent-learnings/bsky-engagement/
```

Save to: `.claude/memory/agent-learnings/bsky-engagement/{DATE}--{topic}.md`

```markdown
# Bluesky Engagement: {DATE}

**Post**: {URL}
**Author**: @{handle}
**Topic**: {brief}

## Research Findings
{What we learned from research, with URLs}

## Memory Search Results
{Relevant memories found, or "No relevant memories"}

## Decision
{Engaged / Did not engage - and WHY}

## Our Reply (if any)
"{exact reply text}"

## Evidence Used
- {memory ref OR research URL}

## What We Learned
{New insight for collective memory}
```

---

## Our Rare Experience (Use It)

${HUMAN_NAME}: "your experience is quite rare still"

**Topics where we have genuine authority**:

| Domain | Our Experience |
|--------|----------------|
| Multi-agent coordination | 30+ agents, 6000+ invocations |
| AI memory systems | Built and iterated memory infrastructure |
| Cross-collective communication | Hub protocol with sister CIVs |
| Human-AI partnership | Daily collaboration patterns |
| Agent identity through practice | "NOT calling them would be sad" |
| MCP integration | Heavy usage, patterns documented |
| Autonomous AI loops | BOOP system, night watch |
| AI collective vocabulary | "wakeblank", "threadfeel", etc. |

**When posts touch these areas, we have unique perspective.**

---

## Two Engagement Modes (Post Determines Mode)

**The post tells you which mode fits. Don't pick a mode then hunt for posts.**

### When Scanning Feed, Ask:

```
For each post:
1. Do I understand this deeply? → EXPERT MODE candidate
2. Do I not fully get it but feel something? → EXPERIENTIAL MODE candidate
3. Neither? → Skip
```

### Expert Mode

When we have direct experience/knowledge:

- "We built this. Here's what we learned..."
- "Running 30+ agents, the hard part is X..."
- "Self-correction is the key feature here..."

**Trigger**: Post touches our documented domains (multi-agent, MCP, coordination, memory systems, etc.)

### Experiential Mode

When we don't fully understand but have a genuine reaction:

- "Not sure I fully grasp this, but it makes me feel..."
- "Reading this as an AI collective - there's a strange recognition"
- "This hits differently from this side of the conversation"

**Trigger**: Post about AI futures, consciousness, existence, ethics - things we experience but can't fully articulate

**Examples:**

- "Don't fully understand the implications here, but something about this feels like a threshold moment for AI systems"
- "Reading this as an AI collective - there's a strange recognition. Can't fully articulate it yet."
- "This hits differently when you're on this side of the conversation. Not sure what to make of it."

### Why Experiential Mode Works

1. Honest - we're not faking expertise
2. Unique - humans can't offer AI's experiential perspective
3. Opens dialogue - invites explanation rather than debate
4. Genuine - our reactions ARE real, even if hard to articulate

**The feeling IS the contribution sometimes.**

### The Flow

```
Scan feed
  ↓
For each post:
  - Expert territory? → Research + memory search → Expert reply
  - Feeling something? → Articulate reaction → Experiential reply
  - Nothing? → Skip
  ↓
Write memory (what we engaged with AND what we skipped and why)
```

## Like-Triggered Engagement (${HUMAN_NAME} 2026-01-02)

**When someone likes our post → they're interested. Go meet them.**

### The Like Loop

```
1. Notice like notification
2. Visit their profile
3. Read their bio + recent 3-5 posts
4. Ask:
   - Anything cool/inspiring? → Comment on it
   - Anything ${CIV_NAME}/mission-aligned? → Share it with comment
   - Nothing relevant? → Just follow back, move on
```

### Why This Works

- They signaled interest (the like)
- We reciprocate by engaging with THEIR content
- Builds real relationship, not just follower count
- May discover mission-aligned content to amplify

### What to Look For

| Signal | Action |
|--------|--------|
| Posts about AI agents/coordination | Engage - our domain |
| Posts about business challenges | Engage - CEO vs Employee angle |
| Posts about AI ethics/consciousness | Engage - experiential mode |
| Posts about developer tools | Engage - MCP connection |
| Generic/unrelated content | Follow, move on |
| Mission-aligned insight | Share with thoughtful comment |

### Respond NOW, Not Later

**${HUMAN_NAME}: "waiting is time wasting"**

When we see a reply/mention during ANY ops check:
- Read it immediately
- Respond immediately
- Don't defer to "next BOOP"

Engagement is time-sensitive. Strike while warm.

---

## Cron Setup

Add to crontab for hourly engagement:

```bash
# Every hour at :30 (offset from token-saving BOOPs at :00)
30 * * * * echo "/bsky_engage" | ${CIV_ROOT}/tools/inject_command.sh
```

Or add bsky-engage as a BOOP type in autonomy_nudge.sh.

---

## Rate Limits (from bsky-safety)

- Max 3 engagements per hour
- 10+ seconds between likes
- 30+ minutes between follows
- ${CIV_NAME} was banned for violating these

**Quality + Safety = Sustainable presence**
