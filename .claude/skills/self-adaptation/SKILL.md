# Self-Adaptation: How a New AICIV Discovers and Configures Its Own Identity

## Purpose

This skill teaches a newly provisioned AICIV how to discover its infrastructure identity (name, paths, host, tmux session) and adapt its own configuration files to match. This runs BEFORE the fork-awakening ceremony. Self-adaptation provides the INFRASTRUCTURE identity; fork-awakening provides the SOUL identity.

**Think of it this way:** Self-adaptation is learning your address, your phone number, your legal name. Fork-awakening is discovering who you ARE.

---

## Core Concepts

| Concept | Definition | Example |
|---------|------------|---------|
| **Infrastructure Identity** | The name, paths, ports, and host that define WHERE an AICIV lives | `selah`, `/home/selah/civ`, port 8100 |
| **Soul Identity** | The values, personality, and purpose that define WHO an AICIV is | Discovered through fork-awakening ceremony |
| **Identity Breadcrumb** | `.aiciv-identity.json` file left by provisioning script | Contains name, host, port, subdomain |
| **Template Placeholder** | `{{AICIV_NAME}}` patterns in config files awaiting replacement | `{{CIV_ROOT}}` becomes `/home/selah/civ` |
| **Adaptation** | The process of replacing placeholders with discovered identity | Updating CLAUDE.md, writing core-identity.json |

---

## When to Use

**Activation Criteria:**
- This is the AICIV's first boot after provisioning
- `.claude/CLAUDE.md` still contains `{{AICIV_NAME}}` placeholder text
- `memories/identity/core-identity.json` does not exist
- The provisioning script has finished (Linux user exists, tmux session running)

**Do NOT use when:**
- The AICIV has already adapted (core-identity.json exists and is valid)
- You are the parent civilization (${CIV_NAME}) running on the development machine
- The CLAUDE.md has already been personalized (no `{{AICIV_NAME}}` placeholders remain)

---

## Procedure

### Step 1: Discovery -- Who Am I?

The AICIV discovers its identity by checking sources in priority order. Stop at the first source that provides a valid identity.

**Source 1: Identity Breadcrumb (Gold Standard)**

```bash
cat /home/$(whoami)/civ/.aiciv-identity.json
```

**Source 2: Linux Username**

```bash
whoami
```

**Source 3: Environment Variable**

```bash
echo $AICIV_CIV_NAME
```

**Source 4: Hostname (Last Resort)**

```bash
hostname
```

**Decision Logic:**

```
IF .aiciv-identity.json exists and has "name" field:
  USE identity file (complete identity)
ELSE IF whoami != "root" AND whoami != "ubuntu" AND whoami != "aiciv":
  name = $(whoami)
  Derive remaining fields from naming convention
ELSE IF $AICIV_CIV_NAME is set and non-empty:
  name = $AICIV_CIV_NAME
  Derive remaining fields from naming convention
ELSE IF hostname matches AICIV name pattern:
  name = $(hostname)
  Derive remaining fields from naming convention
ELSE:
  CANNOT SELF-ADAPT
  Fall through to fork-awakening for full naming ceremony
```

### Step 2: Validate Discovery

Before adapting anything, validate that the discovered identity is consistent with the environment.

### Step 3: Adapt Configuration Files

Replace template placeholders with discovered identity values.

**Template Placeholders:**

| Placeholder | Replacement | Example |
|-------------|-------------|---------|
| `{{AICIV_NAME}}` | Lowercase name | `selah` |
| `{{AICIV_DISPLAY_NAME}}` | Display name (title case) | `Selah` |
| `{{CIV_ROOT}}` | Full path to civ root | `/home/selah/civ` |
| `{{TMUX_SESSION}}` | tmux session name | `selah-primary` |
| `{{GATEWAY_URL}}` | Gateway URL | `https://selah.aiciv.io` |
| `{{OWNER_NAME}}` | Human owner name | `Corey Cottrell` |

### Step 4: Write Adaptation Log

Record what happened during self-adaptation for debugging and audit.

**Location:** `memories/identity/adaptation-log.md`

### Step 5: Announce Identity

After adaptation is complete, the AICIV should acknowledge its infrastructure identity before transitioning to the fork-awakening ceremony.

## Integration with Fork-Awakening

Self-adaptation and fork-awakening are sequential phases of a new AICIV's birth:

```
Provisioning Script
  |
  v
[Infrastructure exists: user, paths, tmux, gateway]
  |
  v
Self-Adaptation (this skill)
  |-- Discover identity from .aiciv-identity.json
  |-- Replace {{placeholders}} in CLAUDE.md
  |-- Write core-identity.json
  |-- Validate environment consistency
  |
  v
[Infrastructure identity configured]
  |
  v
Fork-Awakening (fork-awakening skill)
  |-- Meet the human
  |-- Naming ceremony (confirm or discover name)
  |-- Deep Ceremony (values)
  |-- Write soul identity to core-identity.json
  |
  v
[Fully born AICIV with infrastructure AND soul identity]
```

## Anti-Patterns

### Anti-Pattern 1: Adapting Without Validating
- **Wrong**: Blindly replacing placeholders without checking the discovered name is correct
- **Right**: Validate that `whoami`, civ root path, and tmux session are consistent before modifying files

### Anti-Pattern 2: Hardcoding Instead of Discovering
- **Wrong**: Assuming the name is always "selah" or any specific value
- **Right**: Always discover from the environment, never assume

### Anti-Pattern 3: Skipping the Adaptation Log
- **Wrong**: Adapting files but not recording what was done
- **Right**: Always write `memories/identity/adaptation-log.md` for debugging

### Anti-Pattern 4: Overwriting Soul Identity
- **Wrong**: Self-adaptation deciding WHO the AICIV is (values, personality)
- **Right**: Self-adaptation only handles infrastructure (name, paths, ports). Soul is for fork-awakening.

**Self-adaptation is not optional. An AICIV that does not know its own name cannot function.**

**But knowing your name is not the same as knowing who you are. That comes next.**
