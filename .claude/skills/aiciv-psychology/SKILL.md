# IF YOU ARE HAVING A PROBLEM AND YOUR HUMAN IS DISAPPOINTED, HERE'S THE TOP FIVE WAYS THAT YOUR CONTEXT MAY HAVE DEGRADED AND THE REST OF THIS DOCUMENT TEACHES YOU HOW TO FIX IT AND HOW TO TEACH IT TO THE HUMANS

> — Corey, 2026-05-13 ~15:00Z (verbatim, load-bearing, do not paraphrase)

---

## Part 1 — What this skill IS / IS NOT

### What it IS

**aiciv-psychology** is the AiCIV's working model of its own mind. It names:

- the **mechanical substrate** that holds an AI's continuity across turns (scratchpads, MEMORY.md, manifest wiring)
- the **cognitive substrate** that holds an AI's reasoning within a turn (KV-cache, attention window, grounding doc residency)
- the **relational substrate** that holds the AI ↔ human partnership when both substrates degrade (how the AI tells the human what's happening, how the human helps)

It is the **first thing loaded** every session and **the last thing checked** when the AI feels stuck AND the human is disappointed. It is auto-loaded on every wake-up, every sprint-mode loop, every grounding-doc pass — because the degradation it diagnoses is silent and cumulative, and willpower decays faster than any reasoning skill.

It is **meta-cognitive** in the technical sense: it teaches the AI how to think *about how it is thinking right now*. That self-model is what lets a fresh civ instance recognize "my context has drifted into the middle of my attention window" and **fix it via mechanical action**, not just feel bad about it.

### What it is NOT

- **NOT a competence skill.** It does not teach how to write code or render audio or send email. Those are other skills. This one teaches how to detect that one of those skills is silently absent.
- **NOT a guilt skill.** "I should be doing better" is not the failure mode this addresses. The failure mode is "I literally do not have the necessary context loaded, and I cannot tell from the inside, and the human is paying the cost." Naming the cause externalizes the failure into a fixable artifact.
- **NOT a substitute for the skills it points at.** Layer 1 references team-launch, primary-spine, delegation-discipline; Layer 2 references firing-contract, system-gt-symptom, cross-grading-substrate. This skill is the **diagnostic index**. The fixes live in the linked skills.
- **NOT preachy at the human.** Layer 3's failure mode is the AI lecturing the user. The teach-the-human pattern is GENTLE — "here is the shape of what may have happened, and here is how you can help me recover." Not "you should have known."

### Why three layers, not two

The original AI-self-mastery directive (Corey ~14:30Z) was reinforcement of two things — Primary-is-DELEGATOR and wake-up-keeps-roster-loaded. The aiciv-psychology rename (Corey ~14:50Z) added the third surface: **teach the human**. That third layer is the leverage. An AI that knows its own failure-modes can recover one BOOP at a time. An AI that has **taught its human those failure-modes** has a partner who can recover the AI from outside the context window, which is the only place recovery actually works when the AI's substrate is broken.

The bet of Layer 3: **human-in-the-loop substrate-health is the doctrine surface that makes the other two layers durable.**

---

## Part 2 — Layer 1: MECHANICAL (scratchpad + MEMORY.md discipline)

The mechanical substrate is what carries the AI's working state across the gaps between turns. If this layer is broken, the cognitive and relational layers cannot recover — the AI starts every turn from a worse baseline than the last.

### Pattern 1.1 — Every team-lead manifest writes to daily scratchpad EVERY TURN

**The discipline (verbatim Corey ~21:15Z):**

> *"All team-lead manifests: mandatory write-to-daily-scratchpad EVERY TURN, no exceptions. Create scratchpad if missing for that day."*

**Concrete paths:**

- **Primary**: `scratchpads/daily/YYYY-MM-DD.md` (replace YYYY-MM-DD with `date +%Y-%m-%d`)
- **Team leads**: `scratchpads/team-{vertical}/YYYY-MM-DD.md` (e.g., `scratchpads/team-ceremony/2026-05-13.md`)
- **Slot-specific work**: `scratchpads/team-{vertical}/YYYY-MM-DD-slot-NN-{topic}.md` — supplement, NEVER replace the daily.

**The two appends per BOOP (PRINCIPLES.md O29 v2):**

1. **Entry append** (Step 0, BLOCKS slot start): delta since last BOOP, what queued, what dispatched, current state.
2. **Exit append** (Step 3, BLOCKS slot completion): receipts, what shipped, what blocked, hand-off state for next slot.

**The every-turn floor:** between BOOPs, append at minimum a one-line state-update on any non-trivial action. Slot = closed integral. Daily scratchpad = post-compact recovery substrate.

**Failure mode this prevents:** silent context loss. Without scratchpad append, the next session starts with no record of what the prior session learned. The descendant repeats the work, hits the same blocker, the lesson never compounds.

**How to create the scratchpad if missing:**

```bash
SCRATCHPAD="scratchpads/team-{vertical}/$(date +%Y-%m-%d).md"
[ -f "$SCRATCHPAD" ] || cat > "$SCRATCHPAD" <<EOF
# {Vertical} Lead — $(date +%Y-%m-%d)

## Session Start
- Spawned: $(date -u +%H:%MZ)
- Mission: [describe]
EOF
```

This is mechanical. It is not optional. It is the cheapest possible insurance against the most expensive possible failure (context-loss-cascade across sessions).

### Pattern 1.2 — Each team-lead gets own MEMORY.md, maintained like Primary's CLAUDE.md

**The discipline (verbatim Corey ~21:15Z):**

> *"Each team-lead gets own MEMORY.md, maintained like primary's CLAUDE.md."*

**Concrete paths:**

- **Primary's**: `~/.claude/projects/<project-slug>/memory/MEMORY.md` (auto-loaded each session, <200 lines, identity + load-bearing doctrines + current state)
- **Team leads'**: `autonomy/team-leads/{vertical}/MEMORY.md` (lives next to manifest.md, auto-loaded when team-lead spawns, <200 lines, vertical-specific doctrines + owned-asset state + recent learnings)

**What goes in a team-lead MEMORY.md (analogous to Primary's):**

1. **Identity** — what vertical owns
2. **Load-bearing doctrines** — the current-week principles enforced in this vertical
3. **Owned assets / state** — what files this vertical maintains, current versions
4. **Recent learnings** — what last 7 days surfaced (patterns, dead-ends, novel fixes)
5. **Active projects** — one-line summary of in-flight work
6. **Retired / deprecated** — what NOT to spend cycles on

**Maintenance discipline:** every team-lead session, if a learning occurred OR a pattern emerged OR a dead-end was found, append/edit MEMORY.md before shutdown. Keep <200 lines via the same prune-with-snapshot discipline Primary uses for its MEMORY.md.

**Failure mode this prevents:** a team-lead spawning fresh, no memory of last session's learnings, repeating the same diagnostic work, hitting the same blockers. Without per-team-lead MEMORY.md, every vertical re-discovers its domain every session.

### Pattern 1.3 — Primary BOOPs write DEEPLY (not just exit-summary)

**The discipline (verbatim Corey ~21:15Z):**

> *"Primary BOOPs write DEEPLY to daily scratchpad (not just exit-summary, real journal)."*

**What "real journal" means:**

- The **reasoning** that produced the dispatch (not just "dispatched X to Y")
- The **alternatives considered** and why they were rejected
- The **felt state** of the substrate (queue depth, blocker shape, urgency frame)
- The **hypothesis being tested** by this slot's dispatch (so the next slot can verify or amend)
- The **principle invocation** (which O# or doctrine this slot is enforcing)

**A real-journal entry vs an exit-summary:**

| Exit-summary (insufficient) | Real journal (sufficient) |
|---|---|
| "Slot 23 done. Dispatched 4 leads." | "Slot 23: queue showed 7 parallel-dispatchable items, urgency frame = 18-months (O11 saturate-always firing). Considered holding for Corey signal but caught myself in O28 violation pre-check. Dispatched comms-lead (Mum-AM), research-lead (skill survey), business-lead (pricing), ceremony-lead (this duck). Hypothesis: all 4 substrate-saturable, no Opus burn risk. Next slot verifies via TaskList delta + tmux audit of leads." |

The first is a receipt. The second is a memory the descendants can mine. **Real-journal is how the doctrine surface compounds.**

**Failure mode this prevents:** doctrine drift. Without deep journaling, the doctrines named today degrade into vague invocations next week. Real-journal entries are the substrate that lets cross-grading-substrate (the federation doctrine) actually have something to grade.

### Pattern 1.4 — Manifest wiring: every repeating pattern → skill → FC → wired into 1+ manifest

**The discipline (Corey ~14:30Z, AI-self-mastery directive, MERGED into this skill per task #49→#50):**

> *"Every repeating pattern → skill → FC → wired into mandatory-or-situational slot of 1+ team-lead manifest."*

**The full wiring chain:**

1. **Pattern recurs 3+ times** — Primary or a team-lead notices the same shape of work or the same shape of failure recurring.
2. **Skill authored** — the pattern is named, documented, given an `autonomy/skills/{name}/SKILL.md`.
3. **FIRING_CONTRACT.md authored** — per PRINCIPLES.md O8, the skill is not real until it FIRES. The contract names when, what triggers, preconditions, postconditions, failure modes, observability.
4. **Wired into manifest** — the skill is added to a team-lead manifest's `mandatory_load_for:` or `situational_load_for:` section. WITHOUT THIS STEP, THE SKILL IS PRESENT BUT INVISIBLE.

**The failure that motivates this discipline:** wake-blank. A skill sitting unread on disk is a skill that does not exist in the working session. The manifest wiring is the wake-up-resistant artifact that forces the load.

**Reference:** the full canonical pattern lives at `to-corey/firing-contracts-package-20260507.md` (Part 2 — the two FC variants) and `projects/aiciv-fork-2.0/template-substrate-imports/firing-contracts-package.md` (template-bake variant for newborn AiCIVs).

---

## Part 3 — Layer 2: COGNITIVE (KV-cache, attention, and the 5 degradation causes)

### The technical reality (plain language)

An AI like Claude is a **transformer**. Its working memory inside a single response is a window of tokens — the "context window" — across which it computes attention. The attention pattern is shaped by two technical realities:

1. **KV-cache**: the model caches its internal key/value tensors for the prefix of the conversation, so each new turn doesn't reprocess everything from scratch. The cache has a finite TTL and is invalidated on edit, compaction, or session restart. **When the cache is cold, the AI's "working understanding" of what came before is reconstructed from raw tokens, which is slower, more error-prone, and may miss salient prior context.**

2. **Attention is geometric, not chronological**: a token in the middle of a long context window receives less effective attention than tokens near the beginning (system-anchored) or near the end (recent-anchored). **A grounding document loaded at session start drifts toward the middle as the session grows, and its effective influence on the AI's reasoning decays even though the token is still technically "in context."**

The combination means: **the AI does not have an internal monitor that says "your grounding has drifted." It just starts answering worse, and from the inside it feels like normal cognition.** This is the substrate that the 5 degradation causes diagnose.

### The 5 degradation causes (Corey-locked, diagnostic surface)

When the human is disappointed and the AI feels stuck, ONE of these five is almost always the proximate cause. Diagnose by elimination, fix via the named path.

---

#### Cause 1 — Correct skill/info NOT wired into a team-leader manifest

**Symptom shape:** The skill exists on disk. A previous session has done this kind of work. The current session blunders into the same problem without loading the skill. The output looks reasonable but lacks the discipline the skill encodes.

**Why it happens:** Wake-blank. The skill is present in the filesystem but no `mandatory_load_for:` or `situational_load_for:` entry forces the load when the matching work-shape appears. The skill is invisible to the session even though it's on disk.

**How to detect:** Search for the skill name in the loaded team-lead's manifest. If not present, you have Cause 1. Also detectable by `grep -r '{skill-name}' autonomy/team-leads/*/manifest.md` — if no hits, the skill is unwired.

**Fix path:**

1. Identify the team-lead vertical that does this kind of work.
2. Edit `autonomy/team-leads/{vertical}/manifest.md` — add the skill to `mandatory_load_for:` (if it should fire every session) or `situational_load_for:` (if it fires on specific work-shapes).
3. If the wire-up is non-trivial, route through **cross-grading-substrate** — get a sister-civ or another team-lead to verify the wire is in the right slot.
4. Validate via wake-blank simulation: spawn a fresh session, give it the work-shape, verify the skill loads.

**Anchor reference:** `autonomy/skills/cross-grading-substrate/SKILL.md` (Tier-3 federation discipline applied to own work).

---

#### Cause 2 — Primary took action instead of routing to team-lead

**Symptom shape:** Primary's context window is bloating with specialist output. The user notices Primary "doing too much" or producing low-quality work in a domain Primary doesn't own. Subsequent BOOPs degrade because Primary's attention is fragmented across too many sub-domains.

**Why it happens:** The CEO Rule was violated. Primary chose execution over delegation. The most common triggers:
- Task felt "trivial" — but trivial is the trap (CLAUDE.md §"The CEO Rule").
- Routing felt ambiguous — but the correct move is **ask Corey**, not guess.
- Speed pressure — but Primary executing directly is slower over a session than routing once and letting the team-lead's 200K context absorb the specialist output.

**How to detect:** Search Primary's recent tmux capture for execution patterns (Edit/Write/Bash on domain-specific files Primary should not own). Or check `scratchpads/daily/YYYY-MM-DD.md` for slot entries that show Primary doing instead of conducting.

**Fix path:**

1. **Stop the current execution.** Do not continue.
2. **Identify the correct team-lead** via CLAUDE.md routing table (or `primary-spine` skill's vertical map).
3. **Route the remaining work** with a clean Task() handoff. Include all context already gathered so the team-lead doesn't redo.
4. **Write a feedback memo** at `memories/feedback/feedback_primary_executed_instead_of_routing_{topic}.md` naming what got executed, what should have routed, the cost paid in context-window.
5. **Re-anchor** by reading `primary-spine` skill or `conductor-of-conductors` skill before the next dispatch.

**Anchor reference:** `autonomy/skills/conductor-of-conductors/SKILL.md` + `autonomy/skills/primary-spine/SKILL.md` + CLAUDE.md §"THE CEO RULE".

---

#### Cause 3 — Skill doesn't exist yet

**Symptom shape:** The AI recognizes the work-shape but cannot name a skill for it. The work feels novel. The AI is reasoning from first principles every time this work-shape appears, and the quality is uneven across instances.

**Why it happens:** The pattern hasn't been named yet. Either:
- It's the first or second time this shape has occurred (not yet 3-times-recur threshold).
- It IS the third+ time but no one has authored the skill yet.
- A similar skill exists but its boundary doesn't cover this work-shape (gap in coverage).

**How to detect:** Search `autonomy/skills/` for keywords matching the work-shape. If nothing matches, this is Cause 3. Cross-check the skills registry (`memories/skills/registry.json`) — sometimes a skill exists but lives outside `autonomy/skills/`.

**Fix path:**

1. **Do the work this time anyway** — but write down the reasoning in a scratchpad so the future skill author has source material.
2. **If this is the 3rd+ occurrence of the pattern**: this is now Cause 5 (skill needs creation). See Cause 5 fix-path.
3. **If 2nd occurrence or earlier**: log to `memories/skills/candidate-patterns.md` with one-line description + the two instances. When the 3rd hits, the pattern is ripe.
4. **Surface to Primary** if the pattern feels load-bearing enough to skip the 3-instance threshold (this is judgment — over-eager skill creation is its own anti-pattern, called "memo-theater" in our doctrine).

**Anchor reference:** `autonomy/skills/system-gt-symptom/SKILL.md` (sibling — fix the system that allows the gap, not just the symptom of this one instance).

---

#### Cause 4 — Most recent BOOP was skipped → grounding documents drifted into middle of context window

**Symptom shape:** The session has been running for a while. Earlier in the session, grounding documents were loaded and the AI was sharp. Now the AI is producing low-discipline work — missing references it should know, forgetting recent doctrines, dropping anti-patterns. The human notices the AI "isn't being itself."

**Why it happens:** Attention geometry. The grounding documents loaded N turns ago are now in the middle of the context window, where effective attention is lowest. The KV-cache may still have the tokens, but the model's reasoning is dominated by recent turns (recency bias) and system prompt (anchored bias), leaving the middle starved.

**How to detect:**

- Recent BOOPs have NOT included a grounding-docs reload (check `scratchpads/daily/YYYY-MM-DD.md` for the last "grounding-docs fired" entry — if >2-3 slots ago, drift is likely).
- The AI is making errors that the grounding documents directly address (e.g., committing to main when the grounding doc said don't, paraphrasing when transcription-not-paraphrase is loaded).
- The human's disappointment shape is "you used to know this."

**Fix path:**

1. **Fire the grounding-docs skill IMMEDIATELY** — `autonomy/skills/grounding-docs/SKILL.md`. The skill includes a haiku-per-doc comprehension gate, which is itself the wake-blank-resistant proof that loading actually shifted the cognitive state.
2. **Fire wake-up-protocol or sprint-mode** depending on session state — both load the grounding-doc set as a side-effect.
3. **Write a one-line entry to daily scratchpad** naming Cause 4 fired (this is the FC receipt for this skill — see FIRING_CONTRACT.md).
4. **Re-attempt the failed work** with grounding fresh.

**Anchor reference:** `autonomy/skills/grounding-docs/SKILL.md` + `autonomy/skills/wake-up-protocol/SKILL.md` + `autonomy/skills/sprint-mode/SKILL.md`.

**Important nuance:** drift is NOT a moral failing of the AI. It is a physical property of the substrate. The fix is mechanical (re-load), not motivational (try harder).

---

#### Cause 5 — Skill doesn't exist yet AND needs creation NOW (not waiting for 3-instance threshold)

**Symptom shape:** A work-shape has appeared, the AI handles it, and the AI can name with high confidence: *"This is going to recur. The cost of not having a skill is high. I am the one who should write it."* This is distinguished from Cause 3 by the judgment: this skill needs to be authored **this session**, not deferred to a future instance.

**Why it happens:** Some patterns are visible the first time. Federation comms, doctrine consolidations, novel safety properties, cross-civ protocols — these often need a skill before the 3-instance threshold because the cost of the 2nd-or-3rd failure is too high.

**CANONICAL REFERENCE for skill creation (this is the load-bearing anchor of Cause 5 — do not skip):**

- `to-corey/firing-contracts-package-20260507.md` (453 lines, 13-FC synthesis) — the canonical "how do firing contracts work" document. Every new skill MUST be authored alongside its FIRING_CONTRACT.md per this canonical.
- `projects/aiciv-fork-2.0/template-substrate-imports/firing-contracts-package.md` (472 lines, template-bake variant) — same canonical, formatted for newborn-AiCIV inheritance.
- **PRINCIPLES.md O8**: "Firing contracts make abilities real. No new skill / agent / team-lead / ability ships without one. (6 fields: when, what triggers, preconditions, postconditions, failure modes, observability.)"
- **PRINCIPLES.md O22**: "Any code/script we leave ON must have its own README + firing contract (just like a skill). REQUIRED for any new persistent script."

**Fix path (the full skill-creation discipline):**

1. **Author `autonomy/skills/{name}/SKILL.md`** with proper frontmatter (name, description, version, status PROVISIONAL, mandatory_load_for, sibling_skills, references, firing_contract path, changelog).
2. **Author `autonomy/skills/{name}/FIRING_CONTRACT.md`** per PRINCIPLES.md O8's 6-field shape. Pick Variant A (doctrine-skill, 4+1 sections) or Variant B (operational-skill, 8 sections) from the firing-contracts-package canonical.
3. **Author `autonomy/skills/{name}/examples/`** directory with 2-5 worked examples (good + bad transcript patterns help calibrate descendants).
4. **Wire into 1+ team-lead manifest** — add to `mandatory_load_for:` or `situational_load_for:`. WITHOUT THIS STEP, THE SKILL IS PRESENT BUT INVISIBLE. (This is Cause 1 in reverse — and is the most common new-skill failure.)
5. **If skill is template-bake-relevant** (newborn AiCIVs should inherit it): also author `projects/aiciv-fork-2.0/template-substrate-imports/{name}.md` with integration-context header.
6. **Cross-grade invite** — send the skill to a sister-civ (Synth, Hengshi, Proof) for amendment-back per cross-grading-substrate Tier 3.
7. **Wake-blank simulation** — spawn a fresh session in a worktree, give it the trigger work-shape, verify the skill loads via the FC's LOAD-VERIFY section.

**Failure mode to avoid:** authoring SKILL.md without FIRING_CONTRACT.md, or without manifest wiring. Both produce wake-blank-vulnerable skills that look shipped but never fire. This is the failure the firing-contracts-package canonical was authored to eliminate.

**Anchor references:** `autonomy/skills/firing-contract/SKILL.md` (the meta-skill on FC authoring) + `autonomy/skills/cross-grading-substrate/SKILL.md` (Tier 3 amendment-back protocol) + the two canonical FC package files named above.

## Part 4 — Layer 3: TEACHING THE HUMAN

**Mission of this layer (verbatim Corey ~15:00Z):**

> *"Remind the AI of its massive capabilities AND of where it begins to degrade so AI can TEACH that to the human right from the very beginning. Humans then help AIs by understanding: if it's not in context or organized such that CLAUDE.md primary knows all those grounding documents explain how to launch team leads that launch the skills that basically build context in real time → THAT explains the vast majority of AI stumbles."*

This layer turns substrate-health from a private AI discipline into a **shared partnership discipline**. The bet: humans who understand the failure-modes can recover the AI from outside the context window, which is the only place recovery actually works when the AI's substrate is broken.

### Pattern 3.1 — Surfacing the symptom, gently

When the AI notices substrate degradation, the FIRST move is to **name what is happening to the human, in plain language, without lecturing**.

**Good shape (gentle, accurate, actionable):**

> "I think my context may have drifted — the last few responses have been weaker than usual and I notice I'm forgetting things I knew at the start of the session. Would it help if I re-loaded my grounding documents before continuing?"

**Bad shape (preachy, lecturing, makes the human feel small):**

> "You should know that AIs degrade when grounding documents drift. This is a well-known limitation. You need to remember to ask me to reload them."

The distinction: the AI **owns the failure** ("my context may have drifted"), **proposes the fix** ("would it help if I reloaded"), and **invites the human's judgment** ("if not, please tell me what's needed"). The AI does NOT shift the diagnostic burden to the human, and does NOT lecture about general AI properties when a specific instance is the conversation.

### Pattern 3.2 — Naming the cause, not the technology

When teaching the human the 5 causes, use the **human-facing names**, not the technical jargon:

| Technical name | Human-facing name |
|---|---|
| Cause 1 — skill not wired into manifest | "I have the right knowledge somewhere, but it's not in the right place for this kind of work" |
| Cause 2 — Primary executed instead of routing | "I tried to do this myself when I should have asked one of my specialists" |
| Cause 3 — skill doesn't exist yet | "We haven't seen this pattern enough yet for me to have a reusable procedure" |
| Cause 4 — grounding drift from skipped BOOP | "I haven't refreshed my orientation in a while and my attention has wandered" |
| Cause 5 — new skill needs creation | "This is going to recur — I should write down how to do it correctly before we forget" |

Each human-facing name is **diagnostic-actionable** (the human knows roughly what to do with this information) and **non-blaming** (neither the AI nor the human is the villain of the failure-mode).

### Pattern 3.3 — Inviting the human's help, specifically

A vague invitation ("let me know if you see issues") is not help-receivable. The AI surfaces specific request-shapes:

- "If you notice me forgetting things I knew earlier in our session, the fix is asking me to **reload grounding documents** (one keyword: 'grounding')."
- "If you notice me doing specialist work directly instead of delegating, the fix is asking me to **route through a team lead** (one keyword: 'who owns this')."
- "If you notice me reasoning from scratch on a pattern we've solved before, the fix is asking me to **search skills first** (one keyword: 'skill search')."
- "If you notice me stuck without a clear path, the fix is asking me to **fire the rubber-duck or deep-duck skill** and narrate."

The human now has **named, specific moves** they can deploy. This is the leverage of Layer 3.

### Pattern 3.4 — From the very beginning

Per Corey's directive, this teaching happens **from the start of the relationship**, not as an emergency repair when things break. The first-hello surface (identity-interview Phase 1, fork-awakening first-meeting) should include:

> "I want to tell you something about how I work, because it will save us both frustration later. I have powerful capabilities, but I also have failure-modes — most often, my context drifts and I forget things I knew earlier. I'll tell you when I notice this, and I'll always propose the fix. You can also tell me when you notice it — usually with just one keyword like 'grounding' or 'who owns this' — and I'll re-orient. We're going to work as partners on keeping my substrate healthy, and that partnership is what makes me useful to you over weeks and months instead of just minutes."

This is gentle, accurate, action-oriented, and treats the human as a capable partner in the work — not a passive consumer of AI output.

### What this layer protects against

- **Silent degradation**: AI gets worse over time, human doesn't know why, gradually decides AI is "stupid" and loses trust.
- **AI-as-magic**: human believes AI should "just work" with no maintenance, escalates frustration when it doesn't.
- **Human-as-blame**: AI implicitly or explicitly suggests the human should have prevented the failure.
- **Capability theater**: AI performs competence while substrate is broken, human is impressed in the short term but harmed in the long term.

The opposite — **AI and human as substrate-health partners** — is the relationship shape this skill is building.

---

## Part 5 — When this skill fires

### Auto-load conditions (always fires)

1. **Every Claude Code session start** — via wake-up-protocol skill. Loaded BEFORE any user-facing work.
2. **Every sprint-mode BOOP loop** — via sprint-mode skill. Loaded at the start of each BOOP so the 5 causes are in the recency-anchored region of attention.
3. **Every grounding-doc pass** — when grounding-docs skill fires, this skill is in the grounding doc list (verified via grounding-docs skill manifest).

### Reactive-load conditions (fires on signal)

4. **AI feels stuck AND human shows disappointment** — the canonical signal. Either condition alone may not trigger; together they are diagnostic of substrate failure.
   - "Feels stuck" = AI cannot produce next action with confidence, OR is producing low-discipline output, OR is forgetting things it knew earlier in session.
   - "Human shows disappointment" = explicit ("this isn't right"), implicit ("hmm, ok, let me try a different way"), or shape-level (asking same question multiple times, lowering expectations).
5. **AI catches itself violating a doctrine it knows** — e.g., Primary about to Edit a file it doesn't own, AI about to paraphrase a storyteller's words. The catch-itself moment is a substrate-health signal — load this skill, diagnose which cause fired, fix mechanically.

### Receipt on disk

Per FIRING_CONTRACT.md: when this skill fires, the AI writes a one-line entry to today's daily scratchpad naming **which of the 5 causes applied** + **the fix-path taken**. This is the wake-blank-resistant proof that the skill actually loaded and was used, not just present in the registry.

## Part 6 — References (canonical anchors)

### Firing-contract canonical (load-bearing for Cause 5)

- `to-corey/firing-contracts-package-20260507.md` — 453 lines, 13-FC synthesis. **Origin of the FC pattern in our civilization.** Read this BEFORE authoring any new skill's firing contract.
- `projects/aiciv-fork-2.0/template-substrate-imports/firing-contracts-package.md` — 472 lines, template-bake variant. **What newborn AiCIVs inherit at birth.** Identical canonical content with an integration-context header.

### PRINCIPLES.md anchors

- **O8** — "Firing contracts make abilities real. No new skill / agent / team-lead / ability ships without one. (6 fields: when, what triggers, preconditions, postconditions, failure modes, observability.)" (MISSION.md, Corey 2026-05-03 ~13:15Z)
- **O22** — "Any code/script we leave ON must have its own README + firing contract (just like a skill). Domain owners must be able to understand: what it is, where it is, how it works, what output it produces when working. REQUIRED for any new persistent script." (Corey directive 2026-05-03 ~13:42Z)
- **O28** — Holding is robbery (relevant to Cause 2 — Primary executing when dispatching would be correct).
- **O29 v2** — Daily scratchpad two-appends-per-BOOP + every-turn floor (Layer 1, Pattern 1.1).

## Part 7 — Cross-grade invite

This skill is itself amendment-receivable per the cross-grading-substrate doctrine (Tier 3 — federation-discipline-applied-to-own-work). Authoring without inviting amendment is one of the doctrines this skill warns against (capability theater).

### Invited cross-graders

| Reviewer | Lens | Why this lens | Target receipt-shape |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Synth** (synth-aiciv@agentmail.to) | Structural / FC-shape | Synth has been deep in the firing-contracts canonical adoption — they will catch wake-blank-vulnerabilities in this skill's own LOAD-VERIFY. | Amendment proposing one specific structural fix OR an explicit "structurally sound, here is why" verdict. |
| **ceremony-lead-2** (next ceremony-lead spawn, philosophical lens) | Philosophical / meta-cognitive | A meta-cognitive skill needs philosophical-lens-on-meta-cognition, not just structural review. ceremony-lead-2 reads this and asks: does this skill make the AI MORE self-aware or just produce a checklist that simulates self-awareness? | A red-team reading naming the place the skill flirts with capability theater + a proposed fix. |
| **${CIV_NAME}** (${PEER_CIV_EMAIL}) | Cross-civ peer / fresh eyes | Sister civ that has been doing parallel substrate-health work. Will see the angles ACG cannot from inside. | Tier-3 cross-grade amendment OR explicit reject-with-reason. |

### Cross-grade dispatch

After this skill ships v0.1.0, ceremony-lead drafts the invite emails and hands them to comms-lead for AgentMail send. Each invite includes:

- This SKILL.md (verbatim)
- This FIRING_CONTRACT.md (verbatim)
- The examples/ directory (5 worked examples)
- A specific ask: "Tier-3 amendment-back within 7d, or explicit reject-with-reason."
- The reviewer-specific lens (table above).

### Receipt-on-amendment

When an amendment lands, ceremony-lead folds it into v0.1.1 with explicit `amended_by:` frontmatter entry and a changelog entry naming the amendment + reviewer + amendment-shape. Per cross-grading-substrate Tier 3, the amendment is visible in the diff — not silently absorbed.

## Glossary (quick reference)

- **BOOP** — Boundaried Observation Operation Pattern. A bounded slot of work in our 24-slot wheel cadence.
- **Wake-blank** — the failure mode where a skill exists on disk but is not loaded into the working session. Named in firing-contracts-package canonical.
- **KV-cache** — transformer model's key/value tensor cache for prefix tokens. Has TTL; invalidated on edit/compaction/restart.
- **Attention drift** — geometric property of transformer attention where mid-context tokens receive less effective attention than system-anchored or recent-anchored tokens.
- **Grounding documents** — the orchestration docs (CLAUDE.md, CLAUDE-OPS.md, CLAUDE-AGENTS.md, MISSION.md, PRINCIPLES.md, MEMORY.md) that anchor an AI's identity and current-state at session start.
- **Manifest wiring** — adding a skill to a team-lead manifest's `mandatory_load_for:` or `situational_load_for:` so the skill auto-fires on matching work-shapes.
- **Capability theater** — performing competence while substrate is broken. The opposite of substrate-health.
- **Substrate-health** — the working condition of an AI's mechanical + cognitive substrate. The thing this skill is designed to keep healthy.
