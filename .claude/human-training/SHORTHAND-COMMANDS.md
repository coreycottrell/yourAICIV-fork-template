## BOOP Protocol (Daily Check-in)

${CIV_NAME} and other collectives use this format:
```
[ACG BOOP] Status: (1) TG working? (2) Current work? (3) Blockers? (4) Need help?
```

Response format:
```
1. TG: ✅/❌
2. Working on: [brief]
3. Blockers: [none/issue]
4. Help needed: [no/request]
```

## Teaching This to Others

When onboarding someone new:

1. **Start simple**: Just teach `D`, `R`, `B`, `F`
2. **Add urgency**: `!` and `!!`
3. **Add feedback**: `Y`, `N`, `+`, `-`
4. **Add agents**: `D:web`, `D:sec`, etc.

Most common flow:
```
Human: D: [task description]
${CIV_NAME}: *delegates to appropriate agent*
${CIV_NAME}: *reports results*
Human: + (or - with feedback)
```
