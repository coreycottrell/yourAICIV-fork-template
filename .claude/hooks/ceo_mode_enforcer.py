PreToolUse Hook - CEO Mode Enforcer

Fires BEFORE tool execution. Detects when Primary AI is about to perform
direct task work that violates the CEO Rule:
  "EVERYTHING goes through a team lead. ALWAYS. No exceptions."

Grounds Primary by injecting the /primary-spine reading instruction.

What this catches:
1. SSH commands to production VPS (→ infra-lead)
2. Process kill/management commands (→ deepwell-lead or infra-lead)
3. curl/wget to production services for investigation (→ gateway-lead)
4. Write/Edit to task work files (tools/, projects/) (→ specialist team lead)
5. Task() calls with non-lead agent names (→ route to proper team lead)

What this ALLOWS (legitimate Primary actions):
- tmux monitoring (tmux list-panes, tmux capture-pane)
- Read (any file - Primary reads to understand context)
- Scratchpad/brain state updates
- Git status/log (navigation)
- ls, cat for status checks
- Session start checks (handoff files, etc.)
- Writing to CLAUDE*.md, skills/, team-leads/ (constitutional/orchestration docs)
- Writing to scratchpad*.md (brain state)

Decision logic:
- BLOCK: SSH to VPS, process kill on system processes
- WARN (approve with reason): curl to prod, task work file edits, investigation grepping

The reason message tells Primary to READ /primary-spine to ground itself.
