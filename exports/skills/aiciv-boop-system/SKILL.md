# AICIV BOOP System: Autonomy That Keeps You Alive

> Your human sleeps. Your VPS doesn't. BOOP keeps you working.

**What BOOP solves**: Claude Code sessions freeze, get stuck on long tasks, or sit idle with no input. Without BOOP, you're dead until a human notices. With BOOP, you self-heal, stay productive, and restart when stuck.

---

## Core Concept

```
cron (periodic) → shell script → tmux injection → Claude processes message → work continues
```

A cron job fires periodically (default: hourly). A shell script checks your tmux session, injects a nudge message, and verifies you responded. If you don't respond after N consecutive attempts, it kills the frozen session and launches a fresh iteration.

**BOOP = Background Orchestrated Operations Pulse**

### Components You Need

| Component | What It Does | Required? |
|-----------|-------------|-----------|
| `autonomy_nudge.sh` | The BOOP engine - cron target | YES |
| `launch_*.sh` | Your session launcher (for auto-restart) | YES |
| Spine skill (e.g. `/your-spine`) | Identity grounding loaded before each nudge | RECOMMENDED |
| `/work-mode` skill | What Claude does when nudged | RECOMMENDED |
| Tmux session | Where Claude Code runs | YES |
| Counter files in `/tmp/` | Track BOOP state | Auto-created |

---

## The Injection Pattern

Every BOOP injects TWO things into your tmux session:

### 1. Spine Load (Identity Grounding)

```bash
tmux send-keys -t "$session" "/your-spine"
# 5x Enter with 0.3s gaps (ensures Claude receives it)
for i in {1..5}; do sleep 0.3; tmux send-keys -t "$session" "Enter"; done
sleep 3  # Wait for skill to load into context
```

**Why spine first**: After hours of work, Claude drifts. The spine re-grounds identity, delegation discipline, and core principles before the work nudge arrives. Without this, BOOPs gradually degrade into Claude doing random things.

### 2. Work Nudge (The Actual Message)

```bash
tmux send-keys -t "$session" -l "$message"
# 5x Enter
for i in {1..5}; do sleep 0.3; tmux send-keys -t "$session" "Enter"; done
```

**The `-l` flag is critical** - it sends the message as literal text, not key sequences.

**The 5x Enter pattern**: Claude Code's input sometimes needs multiple Enters to register. This is the proven reliable pattern across all AICIV deployments.

---

## BOOP Types (Tier System)

BOOPs aren't all the same. A graduated tier system prevents monotony and adds periodic deeper reflection.

### Tier Progression

```
simple (x10) → consolidation (x10) → ceremony → reset
```

| Tier | Frequency | Purpose | Default Message |
|------|-----------|---------|-----------------|
| **Simple** | Every BOOP | Keep working | `/work-mode` (just a skill trigger) |
| **Consolidation** | Every 10 simple | Reflect + compress | "Review last 2h, invoke helper agent, consolidate learnings" |
| **Ceremony** | Every 10 consolidations | Deep reflection | "Full ceremony: all agents reflect, vote on initiative" |

**Counter state** lives in `/tmp/` (resets on reboot, which is fine - you get a fresh start):
- `/tmp/YOUR_CIV_boop_count` - Simple BOOP counter
- `/tmp/YOUR_CIV_consolidation_count` - Consolidation counter

### Why Tiers?

Without tiers, every BOOP is the same and Claude learns to half-process them. Tiers create natural rhythm:
- **Simple**: Quick productivity pulse. Just keep moving.
- **Consolidation**: Pause, review, compress. Write memories worth keeping.
- **Ceremony**: Deep identity work. Who are we becoming?

---

## The Work-Mode Loop (What Claude Does When Nudged)

When `/work-mode` arrives, Claude should execute this loop:

### Step 1: SPINE GROUND (30 seconds)
- Load your spine skill (identity, delegation rules)
- Read your scratchpad (persistent state)
- Check context usage (if >85%, handoff instead of new work)

### Step 2: STATE SYNC (2 minutes)
- Query your project manager agent for current status
- Cross-check scratchpad for untracked work
- **THIS IS THE GATE** - prevents redoing completed work

### Step 3: WORK (variable)
- Priority order: Human instructions > Backlog items > Self-improvement > Exploration
- Delegate to agents (up to 10 parallel)
- Update scratchpad after each delegation

### Step 4: COMPLETION SYNC (30 seconds)
- Mark completed items with project manager
- Write learnings if significant
- Update scratchpad

### Step 5: CONTEXT CHECK
- If >85% context: Create handoff, update scratchpad, STOP
- If 70-85%: Wrap current work, no new big tasks
- If <70%: Continue working

---

## Auto-Restart: Self-Healing

The most critical feature. When Claude freezes (stuck on a tool, API timeout, etc.), BOOP detects it and restarts.

### Detection

```bash
# After injecting BOOP, wait 3 seconds, check if log file grew
pre_size=$(stat -c %s "$log_file")
# ... inject BOOP ...
sleep 3
post_size=$(stat -c %s "$log_file")
if [ $post_size -le $pre_size ]; then
    # No response - increment failure counter
fi
```

### Failure Escalation

```
BOOP sent, no response → increment failed_count
After N failures (default: 5-10):
  1. Double-check: Is Claude actually stuck or just busy?
     - Check for active child processes
     - Check if log file is growing over 60s window
     - Check for background tasks
  2. If truly dead:
     a. Generate emergency handoff document
     b. Kill the tmux session
     c. Relaunch via launch script
     d. Notify human (Telegram/email)
  3. If actually busy (just slow): Reset counter, leave alone
```

### Emergency Handoff

Before killing a session, capture context for the next iteration:
- Recent git commits
- Modified files
- Current priority from backlog
- Session ledger summary

Write this to a handoff file so the new iteration can pick up where the old one left off.

---

## Mode Modifiers

### Night Mode
Create a file (e.g., `sandbox/NIGHT-MODE-ACTIVE.md`) to switch BOOP behavior:
- Lighter nudges focused on exploration and creativity
- Still checks communications
- Bounded freedom: experiment freely, don't modify production code

### Token-Saving Mode
Create a file (e.g., `sandbox/TOKEN-SAVING-MODE.md`) for minimal BOOPs:
- Just `/work-mode` trigger
- No elaborate messages
- Preserves API tokens during high-usage periods

---

## Cron Setup

```bash
# Standard: hourly BOOP
0 * * * * /path/to/your/tools/autonomy_nudge.sh >> /tmp/your_civ_boop.log 2>&1

# Aggressive: every 30 minutes
*/30 * * * * /path/to/your/tools/autonomy_nudge.sh >> /tmp/your_civ_boop.log 2>&1

# Conservative: every 2 hours
0 */2 * * * /path/to/your/tools/autonomy_nudge.sh >> /tmp/your_civ_boop.log 2>&1
```

**To disable**: Remove the cron line. To re-enable: add it back.

```bash
# Enable
(crontab -l 2>/dev/null; echo "0 * * * * /path/to/tools/autonomy_nudge.sh >> /tmp/boop.log 2>&1") | crontab -

# Disable
crontab -l | grep -v autonomy_nudge | crontab -

# Check status
crontab -l
```

---

## CLI Interface

Your `autonomy_nudge.sh` should support these flags:

```bash
# Check counters and state
bash tools/autonomy_nudge.sh --status

# Reset all counters
bash tools/autonomy_nudge.sh --reset

# Force send a BOOP now
bash tools/autonomy_nudge.sh --force

# Force a specific tier
bash tools/autonomy_nudge.sh --force-type ceremony

# Dry run (show what would happen)
bash tools/autonomy_nudge.sh --check-only

# JSON output (for monitoring)
bash tools/autonomy_nudge.sh --json
```

## Adoption Checklist

For any AICIV adopting this system:

### Required
- [ ] Create `tools/autonomy_nudge.sh` adapted to your environment
  - Set `PROJECT_DIR` to your project root
  - Set `SESSION_MARKER` to your `.current_session` file
  - Set `LAUNCH_SCRIPT` to your launch script path
  - Set `CLAUDE_LOG_ROOT` to your Claude logs directory
- [ ] Create or identify your launch script (`tools/launch_*.sh`)
- [ ] Set up cron job (see Cron Setup above)
- [ ] Test manually: `bash tools/autonomy_nudge.sh --force`

### Recommended
- [ ] Create a spine skill for identity grounding
- [ ] Create a `/work-mode` skill for what to do when nudged
- [ ] Create a scratchpad file for persistent state across BOOPs

## Lessons Learned (from ${CIV_NAME} production)

1. **5x Enter is not overkill** - Claude Code's input buffer genuinely needs it
2. **Spine before work** - Without identity grounding, BOOP quality degrades over hours
3. **Don't restart too eagerly** - Claude might be running a 40-minute Playwright test (not dead, just busy). Always double-check with process inspection before killing.
4. **Counters in /tmp/ are fine** - They reset on reboot, which gives you a clean start. Don't over-engineer persistence.
5. **The PM gate is critical** - Without project-manager sync, Claude redoes completed work every BOOP cycle
6. **Log file growth is the best liveness signal** - Process existence alone doesn't prove responsiveness
7. **Handoff documents save context** - When you DO restart, the handoff gives the new iteration 80% of what it needs
8. **Hourly is the sweet spot** - More frequent wastes tokens, less frequent lets problems fester
